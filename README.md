# RVDASM

A RISC-V disassmbler written in rust.

## Key features

* **Correct**: code-gen from riscv-opcodes
* **Programmer-friedly**: outputs to struct, not string
* **Simple**: easy to read and modify

The `isa.rs` file is generated from [iansseijelly:riscv-opcodes](https://github.com/iansseijelly/riscv-opcodes).
This repo is also registered as a submodule in `${ROOT}/riscv-opcodes`.
Run `gen.sh` in that repo to generate `isa.rs` and `isa_consts.rs`.

## Usage

Example:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run  --example dasm -- --file [ELF] --print
```
